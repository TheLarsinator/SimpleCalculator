# SimpleCalculator
My first android app. It has a few calculator functions, such as complex math, trig and time.

Feel free to build and use it, but don't republish it as your own. You can clone this repo, and then open it in Android Studio.
From here it is very easy to build and install the app on either an emulator or on a phone. Don't hesitate to let me know if there 
is something wrong with the code structure, as I'm still learning Android.

Hope you like the app, and find some use for it.
